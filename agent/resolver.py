"""
Time resolver: converts natural language time phrases to actual datetimes.
Central place for all time resolution logic.

WHY this design:
- Vague phrases ("before lunch", "evening") resolve using config.TimeWindows
- Exact time expressions ("10 am", "tomorrow at 7 pm", "subah 10 baje") take precedence over vague words
- Longer vague phrases ("lunch se pehle") are matched before shorter substrings ("lunch")
- Results flagged needs_confirmation=True include the reasoning
- All times are in Asia/Kolkata timezone
